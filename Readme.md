## Description of the run_analysis.R script

This is the R script used for creating the tidy dataset from several data files from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 


### Source of data

This analysis is based on data generated by Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012


### Desription of the script

Test (**x_test.txt**) and train (**x_train.txt**) measurement data were merged together with the labels of the variables (**test/y_test.txt** and **y_train.txt**), performed activities (**activity_labels.txt**), and subjects (**test/subject_test.txt** and **subject_train.txt**). 
From the merged dataset (**whole_dataset**) only the variables with the *mean* and *standard deviation* were extracted. The resulting tidy dataset (**dataset_select**)was exported to the **dataset_select.txt** file.

Additional dataset (**dataset_summary**) was created by calculating average values of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**The variables are described in the Codebook file.**
